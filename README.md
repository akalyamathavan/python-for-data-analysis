**Data Analysis using NumPy and Pandas**

**Project overview:**
This assignment demonstrates the use of NumPy and Pandas libraries in Python to perform basic data analysis operations. The tasks include array creation, inspection, slicing, mathematical operations, and data manipulation using Series and DataFrames.

Technologies Used

  1.Python 3.x
  2.NumPy
  3.Pandas

**NumPy Array Operations:**

1. 1D NumPy Array

Created a 1D NumPy array to store daily average temperatures for Week 1.

Inspected array properties such as shape, data type, and size.


2. Array Operations

Converted temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

Calculated maximum, minimum, and mean temperatures.


3. Array Slicing

Extracted temperatures for:

First three days

Weekend (last two days)

Middle three days



4. 2D NumPy Array

Created a 2D array representing temperatures for two weeks.

Inspected shape, data type, and total elements.

Extracted weekend temperatures for both weeks.

**Pandas Series:**

1. Creating Series

Created a Pandas Series named marks with custom index labels (Rank1 to Rank5).


2. Indexing and Filtering

Accessed values using iloc and loc.

Filtered marks greater than 90 using boolean masking.


3. Series Manipulation

Updated the mark of Rank1 to 100.

Removed Rank5 safely from the Series.

Calculated CGPA by dividing marks by 10.

 **Pandas DataFrame:**

1. Creating DataFrame

Created a DataFrame named transactions containing:

TransactionID

ProductCategory

Region

Amount



2. Data Exploration

Displayed head, tail, shape, columns, and data types.

Filtered data based on conditions.

Found value counts and unique values.

Grouped data by region and calculated mean amount.


3. DataFrame Manipulation

Updated transaction amount for a specific TransactionID.

Added a new column Discount.

Removed a specific row.

Deleted the Discount column.

**Conclusion:**

This assignment helped in understanding the basics of NumPy and Pandas, including data creation, manipulation, and analysis. These skills are essential for data analysis and data science projects.
